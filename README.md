Neighborhood Map
======
##### Neighborhood Map Project for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program

###### The purpose of this project is to use third party APIs to pull data for different locations dynamically.
The [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) and the [Weather Underground web API](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api) were both used to give the user information about breweries in the Salt Lake City area.

The app is required to:
* Use at least 1 non-Google API
* Retrieve all data asynchronously
* Be properly built using [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com)
* Contain a list of locations that are displayed on a map and can be filtered.
* Be totally responsive
